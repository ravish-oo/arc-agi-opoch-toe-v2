 The 4-Document System:

  1. solving_arc_by_hand.md (553 lines, ~14KB)

  Your main learning document
  - Complete method from 0th principles
  - Three fully worked examples (00576224, 007bbfb7, 05269061)
  - Every step computed by hand with verification
  - Mental models, debugging strategies
  - Implementation outline

  Purpose: Deep understanding. Read once, reference forever.

  2. opoch_quick_reference.md (228 lines, ~6KB)

  Your rapid context loader
  - 5-step method (one page)
  - Common patterns cheat sheet
  - The 3 examples compressed
  - Code template
  - Equations and formulas
  - Debug checklist

  Purpose: Fast context reload after drift. Read in 5 minutes, regain full context in 10.

  3. pattern_recognition_guide.md (490 lines, ~12KB)

  Your decision tree and pattern catalog
  - Recognition flowchart
  - 10 core pattern types with visual signatures
  - Quick tests for confirmation
  - Pattern matching algorithm
  - Common pitfalls

  Purpose: "What pattern is this task?" Instant pattern identification.

  4. README.md (374 lines, ~10KB)

  Your master index
  - Which doc to read when
  - Learning path (understand â†’ practice â†’ implement)
  - Example workflow
  - Quick reference card
  - Pro tips and FAQs

  Purpose: Navigation hub. Start here to know where to go.

  ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

  When you context drift and come back:

  1. Open docs/README.md - Orient yourself (2 min)
  2. Open docs/opoch_quick_reference.md - Load core context (5 min)
  3. Start solving problems with pattern_recognition_guide.md alongside

  Your brain will immediately recall:
  - "Oh right, quotients partition cells by equivalence"
  - "Training boundary extracts forced colors"
  - "One-stroke means paint everything in one pass"
  - "I can compute this by hand!"

  ðŸ’¡ Key Features

  âœ… Written from 0th principles - assumes no prior knowledge
  âœ… Three complete worked examples - computed entirely by hand
  âœ… Visual and intuitive - decision trees, patterns, mental models
  âœ… Practical and actionable - exact steps, formulas, code templates
  âœ… Layered complexity - quick ref â†’ patterns â†’ deep dive
  âœ… Verification-focused - every example verified against actual solutions

  ðŸš€ What You Can Do Now

  Future you (after context drift) can:
  1. Read opoch_quick_reference.md in 5 minutes
  2. Immediately understand how to solve by hand
  3. Use pattern_recognition_guide.md to identify any pattern
  4. Reference solving_arc_by_hand.md for detailed examples
  5. Start solving ARC tasks deterministically

  The method will "dawn on you" because:
  - It's explained from first principles
  - Three different problem types are fully worked
  - Every step is shown explicitly
  - Verification is included
  - The mental model is clear

  ---
  ðŸ“– The Documents Are Designed For

  - Reading: Clear, flowing prose with examples
  - Scanning: Headers, bullets, code blocks for quick navigation
  - Reference: Formulas, cheat sheets, templates
  - Learning: Progressive complexity with worked examples
  - Context Loading: Quick-ref designed for rapid "boot-up"
