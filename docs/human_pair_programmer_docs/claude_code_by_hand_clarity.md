🎯 Usage Pattern for Future-Me

  After context drift, read in this order:

  1. opoch_quick_reference.md (5 min)
    - Reload: "Oh right, it's 5 steps: Present, Quotient, Boundary, Colorizer, One-stroke"
  2. bridge_intuition_to_formal.md (10 min)
    - Precision: "Quotient = truth partition q by lawful forgettings F"
    - Parameters: "WL rounds=5, residues≤6, views depth=2"
    - Formula: "Y* = U⁻¹(Σ 𝟙_q·Φ*)"
  3. Now I'm fully reloaded and can:
    - Solve problems by hand
    - Understand formal specifications
    - Implement the solver
    - Verify correctness

  Total reload time: 15 minutes to full context!

  🎉 The Complete Package

  I now have everything needed to:

  1. Reload context quickly (5-15 min)
  2. Understand intuitively (by-hand examples)
  3. Formalize precisely (map to anchor specs)
  4. Recognize patterns (decision trees)
  5. Implement correctly (parameters + pseudocode)
  =============
   When I solve by hand, the flow is:
  1. Look at train pairs → infer Δ from original dimensions
  2. Canonize all inputs (train + test) via Π
  3. Build Qt spec from canonized train inputs
  4. Canonize train outputs with same D8 transform as their paired inputs
  5. Run ladder refinement to build Bt
  6. Paint each canonized test using Bt + Δ
  7. Un-canonize outputs

  ✓ The flows match exactly! The code follows the abstract math perfectly.
