## The Learning Path

### Stage 1: Understand (2-3 hours)
1. Read `ARC_AGI_math.pdf` - Get the theory
2. Read `solving_arc_by_hand.md` - See it in practice
3. Work through the 3 examples by hand
4. Verify your solutions match

**Goal**: Can you explain the method to someone else?

### Stage 2: Practice (5-10 hours)
1. Pick 10 random training tasks
2. For each task:
   - Use `pattern_recognition_guide.md` to identify pattern
   - Use `solving_arc_by_hand.md` method to solve
   - Compute test output by hand
   - Verify against solution
3. Build your mental pattern library

**Goal**: Can you solve a task by hand in < 15 minutes?

### Stage 3: Implement (ongoing)
1. Use `opoch_quick_reference.md` code template
2. Implement quotient computation
3. Implement boundary extraction
4. Implement colorizer
5. Test on solved examples
6. Expand pattern library

**Goal**: Can you code solutions that match your hand computations?

## The Core Philosophy

### You Are Not Guessing

The Opoch method is **deterministic**:
- One formula
- One answer
- No search
- No probability

### You Are Discovering Structure

Every ARC task has **unique mathematical structure**:
- A quotient (partition of space)
- A boundary (constraints from training)
- A colorizer (deterministic assignment)

Your job: Find that structure.

### You Can Do It By Hand

**If you can't compute it by hand, you don't understand it.**

The documents teach you to:
1. See the structure
2. Compute by hand
3. Verify your understanding
4. Then code it

---

## Quick Reference Card

### The 5 Steps (Always Do These)

```
1. NORMALIZE  → Present(inputs)
2. QUOTIENT   → Compute Qt by refinement
3. BOUNDARY   → Extract Bt from training
4. COLORIZER  → Build Φt (forced + admissible)
5. ONE-STROKE → Paint test input
```

### The Formula

```
Yt,∗ = U⁻¹ₜ((Φₜ ∘ qₜ)(ΠGₜ(Xt,∗)))
```

### The Axioms

- **A0**: No minted differences
- **A1**: Exactness, no remainder
- **A2**: Composition by equality

### The Question

**"Which cells are equivalent using only input features?"**

That's your quotient.

## Example Workflow

**Scenario**: You see a new ARC task

```
1. Open pattern_recognition_guide.md
   → Follow decision tree
   → Identify pattern type

2. Open opoch_quick_reference.md
   → Find similar pattern in cheat sheet
   → Review quotient structure

3. Work by hand
   → Compute quotient for first training pair
   → Extract boundary
   → Build colorizer
   → Apply to test input

4. Verify
   → Does it work on ALL training pairs?
   → Does test output make sense?

5. Code it
   → Use template from quick reference
   → Translate hand computation to code
```

## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Always Work Multiple Training Examples
Never trust a pattern from just one example. Verify on ALL.

### Tip 2: Start with the Smallest Training Example
It usually reveals the core pattern most clearly.

### Tip 3: Draw the Equivalence Classes
Literally draw lines/colors showing which cells are equivalent.

### Tip 4: Check Your Work
Apply your formula to training inputs. Do you get training outputs exactly?

### Tip 5: Trust the Math
If it works on training, it works on test. The math is sound.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I can't find the quotient?**
A: Start simple (color + position). Refine iteratively. Check for:
- Modulo patterns (i%k, j%k)
- Diagonal patterns ((i+j)%k)
- Block patterns (i//k, j//k)
- Neighborhood patterns
- Component IDs

**Q: What if multiple patterns seem to fit?**
A: Test each on ALL training examples. Only one will work deterministically.

**Q: What if the quotient is too complex?**
A: Break it down. Layer features one at a time until classes are disjoint.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A:
1. Read the training examples side-by-side
2. What changed? What stayed same?
3. Try the smallest example first
4. Look for ANY structure (even simple)
5. Consult pattern_recognition_guide.md

**Q: How do I know if I'm right?**
A: If you can compute ALL training outputs from your formula, you're right.
